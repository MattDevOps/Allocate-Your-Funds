  This site is dedicated to helping you save for retirement. It's not always something we think about, and when we do:<br></br>
  <li class="container offset-md-1"> It's only for a brief period before moving onto the next priority on our list.
    <li class="container offset-md-1"> Unfortunatetely (or, perhaps, fortunately), retirement often hits us earlier than we expect <br> </br>
  We all want to enjoy those days to the best of our abilities. <br>
  Our tool will help you decide where and how to allocate your money so that <br>
  you have enough cash to spend when your working days are over.

<p>The old rule of thumb used to be that you should subtract your age from 100 - and that's the percentage of your portfolio that you should keep in stocks. For example, if you're 30, you should keep 70% of your portfolio in stocks. If you're 70, you should keep 30% of your portfolio in stocks. </p>
<p>However, with Americans living longer and longer, many financial planners are now recommending that the rule should be closer to 110 or 120 minus your age. That's because if you need to make your money last longer, you'll need the extra growth that stocks can provide.</p>
<p>Our product will tell you exactly how and where to invest your assets. Registering is completely free.
